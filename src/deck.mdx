# Top 10 Web Application Security Risks

<Step>

- Injection
- Broken Authentication
- Sensitive Data Exposure
- XML External Entities (XXE)
- Broken Access Control
- Security Misconfiguration
- Cross-Site Scripting XSS
- Insecure Deserialization
- Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

</Step>

<Note>

- Injection:
  - Sending untrusted data to an interpreter - SQL Injection
- Sensitive:
  - Includes unencrypted or weakly encrypted data
- Access Control:
  - Restrictions not properly enforced.
- Misconfiguration:
  - Most commonly seen issue
  - Default configs, open cloud storage
- XSS:
  - Execute scripts in the user's browser.
- Deserialization:
  - Leads to remote code execution
- Logging:
  - Lets attackers stay around

</Note>

# Cross-site scripting

---

## Cross-site scripting

- Code is injected into a trusted site.
- User's browser executes the code as if it came from the site.
- Malicious code has access to any browser data for that site.

<Step>

### Potentially compromised data

<Step>

- Cookies
- Session tokens
- Local storage
